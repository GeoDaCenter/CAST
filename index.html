    </h3>

    <p>CAST is a free and open-source, cross-platform program (Windows, Mac OSX and Linux) designed to detect spatial
      patterns and trends for event and area data. The idea is to make it easy to represent different dimensions and
      contexts of space-time data (such as crime data) in views such as maps, graphs, and calendars that can be animated
      over time.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="img/cast_intro1.png" style="max-width:406px; width:100%;">
    </p>


    <p>
      The program runs on three operating systems: Windows, MacOSX and Linux (Windows and Mac OSX are available for
      download; Linux needs to be compiled from the source code). It is designed as a user-friendly interface to <a
        href="http://pysal.github.io">PySAL</a>, the spatial analysis library developed by Dr. Serge Rey and colleagues
      in Python that serves as the code base for its functionality.
    </p>

    <p>
      The interface of CAST is similar to GeoDa s but GeoDa is designed for the analysis of one area-level dataset at a
      time while CAST can display multiple shapefiles simultaneously as layers in one view and/or as separate views.
      Like GeoDa, CAST reads so-called shapefiles, the geographic file format related to ESRI's ArcGIS software, the
      most widely used commercial Geographic Information System (GIS).
    </p>

      <a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true"
          class="octicon octicon-link"></span>What you will need...</a>
    </h3>

    <p>
      If all you have is a *.csv text file with XY coordinates, you can use the <a
        href="http://geodacenter.github.io/download.html">GeoDa software</a> to create a point shapefile file and save
      it for import into CAST. For instance, see the sample data from San Francisco available here.
    </p>

    <p>
      CAST allows analysts to aggregate point data on the fly to areas and to specified time periods (and to save the
      space- and time-aggregated data as a new dbf file). To analyze spatial data over time, a date field needs to be
      specified. For point shapefiles, each record will have a time stamp, often with the date and time (for the San
      Francisco sample data, use the Date and Time fields). You can specify custom formats for these date and time
      fields in CAST but for automatic detection of the date field, it is easiest to have a separate field for the date
      and time of an event. For instance, if the data field is recorded as ’05/01/2011 00:00:00’, then analysts should
      turn this into two separate fields such as date = ’05/01/2011’ and time = ’00:00:00’, before loading the data into
      CAST. For polygon shapefiles without point data, crimes need to already be aggregated for specific time periods
      (one period per column).
    </p>

    <h3>What You Can Do with CAST</h3>


    <p>Like its sister software <a href="http://geodacenter.github.io/">GeoDa</a>, CAST provides a user-friendly and
      graphical interface to methods of exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) for space-time data. All ESDA views are
      linked to allow analysts to explore relationships across these dimensions.
      Using statistical significance tests, CAST includes several cluster maps and trend graphs to detect where
      concentrations of cevents are higher or lower than expected.
    </p>

          class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Multi-layers in CAST</a>
    </h3>

    As is common in Geographic Information Systems, CAST allows analysts to load multiple layers in one view. The
    figures below show examples of how multiple layers can be used in CAST, for instance, to display incidents of
    robberies with percentile maps, heatmaps, and cluster maps.

          class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Dynamic Maps and Graphs</a>
    </h3>

    <p>
      Below is an example of the settings and results for a heatmap, with crime incidents pooled across time. The
      interface for dynamic cluster maps contains a series of micromaps for each specified time period (such as 1-month
      intervals) below a larger map of the respective time period that is highlighted in the micromaps. The micromaps
      can be displayed or hidden by right-clicking on the main map. Further, the animation across time can be started,
      paused and stopped through the controls in the toolbar for all dynamic maps and graphs (including calendar maps
      and trend graphs).

          class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Dynamic Calendar Maps and Graphs</a>
    </h3>

    <p>
      Calendar maps integrate two monthly calendar views with a regular CAST map view: Micro calendars from January to
      December are shown with enlarged versions of two months that correspond to a selection of months in the micro
      calendars. The days in the two calendars are color-coded based on the number of crimes (events) that occurred on
      each day, with lighter green colors for smaller frequencies and darker green shading for larger ones. In addition,
      the enlarged two-month calendar also includes the date and frequency count for each day. Finally, bar charts on
      the vertical axis of the calendar summarize the number of crimes for each week while bar charts on the horizontal
      axis display the sum of crimes for each day of the week.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="img/calendarmap.png" style="max-width:406px; width:100%;">
    </p>

    <p>
      In the dynamic version of the calendar map each day in the enlarged calendars is highlighted sequentially and the
      corresponding points for this day are displayed on the map.
    </p>

          class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Dynamic Trend Graphs</a>
    </h3>

    <p>
      To track frequencies of crime over time, CAST includes three types of trend graphs: 1) a stand-alone static trend
      graph with crime counts on the vertical axis and time periods on the horizontal axis, 2) a dynamic trend graph
      that integrates this stand-alone trend graph with a map view, and 3) a significant trend graph that highlights
      statistically significant time runs within the time series associated with an area.

    </h3>





    <p>
      CAST contains two types of cluster maps for area data that are based on statistical tests: local Moran’s I and
      local G statistics. The local Moran’s I test that the Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) maps are
      based on assesses to what extent values in one area are similar to the average value of neighboring areas. The
      LISA map displays four significant options: <font color="red">Hotspots</font> (high values in a given area
      surrounded by high values in a neighboring area), <font color="blue">coldspots</font> (low area values near low
      neighboring values), and two so-called spatial outliers (low values surrounded by high and vice versa).
