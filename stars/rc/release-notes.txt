OpenGeoDa 0.9.9.11 Release Notes

Changes since 0.9.9.10:
- "Select All... Cores, Neighbors of Cores, Cores and Neighbors"
  added to LISA maps as a right-click-popup menu option to aid
  in LISA analysis.
- "Add Neighbors To Selection" right-click-popup menu option added
  to LISA maps and to Table (when a weights file has been loaded).
- Added limited support for DBF date field.  Dates are treated
  like an integer, but are limited to 8 digits long and must be
  in the format YYYYMMDD.  For example Jan 31, 2011 will appear
  as 20110131.
- Tested on Ubuntu 9, 10, and 11 for both 32-bit and 64-bit.

Changes since 0.9.9.9:
- An unlimited number of DBF fields is now supported.  Note
  that some older DBF programs only support a limited number of
  fields, but there appears to be no standard for what is acceptable.
- Fixed an issue where the number of outliers calculated by Box Map,
  Box Plot, and Cartogram map would sometimes slightly disagree.
- Fixed an issue where program would hang when a Moran's Scatter Plot
  for a weights file containing isolates is displayed an isolates are
  selected in another view.

Changes since 0.9.9.8:
- Moran's I, LISA maps and LISA box plot now correctly handle
  weights files with neighborless observations.  Notice that
  a new category has been added in LISA maps for neighborless
  observations.  Neighborless observations are completely excluded
  from Moran's I calculations and from LISA box plot.

Changes since 0.9.9.7:
- The loading time for point-data shapefiles significantly reduced.
- it is now possible to open a weights file that was created from a
  different shp file than the shp file that is currently opened: only
  the number of observations and the id variable in current dbf file
  need to match.
- Re-added variable and weighs selection toolbar icons
- Increased precision of Shp to Bnd export to 10 digits after the
  decimal.

OpenGeoDa 0.9.9.7 Release Notes

Changes since 0.9.9.6:
- LISA maps a now fully synchronized again
- Newly created weights files are now loaded into OpenGeoDa
  automatically.
- Weights can now be easily selected and created everywhere that
  they are needed.
- New fields can be added to the table from within the Field Calculation
  dialog.

Changes since 0.9.9.5:
- Fixed an issue with mouse selection on OSX where a selection
  rectangle would automatically start in the upper-left-hand corner
  when mouse focus first moved between two windows.
- Added some white-space between Condition Plot cells for maps.
- Weights Characteristics Histogram: when neighborless observations
  (isolates) are detected, a button appears in the histogram for
  selecting all neighborless observations.
- Added observation counts to cell windows in all Condition Plots.

Changes since 0.9.9.4:
- Histogram was sometimes treating values as integers when it should
  have been treating them as general floats.
- The labels in the "Save Regression Results" were mixed up.  This
  has been resolved.
- In conditional plot, the X/Y axis for each scatterplot cell was did
not match the labeling.
- Box Plot graphics are improved.  The median is displayed clearly
  as an orange line, and the mean is a green dot.  Observation
  selection behavior is also fixed.
- Conditional Box Plot view now works properly.

Changes since 0.9.9.3:
- Fixed a bug in Regression where values for R^2 and lambda/rho
  were invalid when isolates present in the weights file.
- Reenabled ability to change order of variables in PCP map
  by dragging on the control circles.  Dragging behavior changed
  so that a dragged variable will be inserted between the two variables
  that it is dragged to (ie, the user should drag the control line
  between control lines, rather then on top of another control line).
- Weights Histogram now appears the same as in Legacy.
  it is once again very easy to see if there are any isolates in
  the weights file.

Changes since 0.9.9.2:
- Fixed a serious problem where Spatial Lag Model and Spatial
  Error regression models would give bad results when opening
  the Regression dialog directly from a DBF file.  This bug
  only existed in the 0.9.9.1 and 0.9.9.2 releases.

Changes since 0.9.9.1:
- Default number of digits after the decimal for new floating
  point Table entries is nine rather than four.

Changes since 0.9.9.0:
- Fixed a bug where algorithms that use a spatial lag,
  such as Moran's I, would produce incorrect results for
  GWT weights files.
- Lisa clusters are now updated when the significance
  level is changed: non-significant clusters are now
  categorized correctly when save to the Table.

Changes since 0.9.8.19:
- Reduced size of toolbar to less than 800 pixels wide.
  Thematic Map toolbar icons have been consolidated
  into a single icon with a drop-down menu.

Changes since 0.9.8.18:
- Last-used variable settings remembered
- non-significant LISA categories now recorded as 0 when
  saving to the Table.
- Table shows all decimal places for floating point numbers
  according to the precision field in the DBF file.
- Fixed a problem where floating point numbers in a DBF
  file would get truncated when OpenGeoDa was running
  on a computer that uses "," as a decimal separator.
- When importing data from a txt file, OpenGeoDa defaults
  to 9 digits of precision after the decimal place in the DBF file. 

Changes since 0.9.8.17:
- Restored fast loading times for Table and Map
- Fixed a potential crash in Shape to Boundary conversion

Changes since 0.9.8.16:
- Improved the appearance of map in Conditional Plot
- Options to change the colors in Map Movies now appear
  in the Options menu for the Map Movie.
- Fixed an issue with Copy to Clipboard and Save As
- Progress Bars added for shp file loading and Regression
- Fixed bugs in Quantile map and improved so that number
  of available Quantiles is limited to number of different
  values in variable or nine, whichever is less.
- Can now use GWT for Rate calculation in Table
- Miscellaneous smaller bug fixes.

Changes since 0.9.8.15:
- Ability to specify float, int, or string data types
  when adding a new column to the table.
- Fixed an issue with panning and zooming introduced
  in release 0.9.8.15
- Other minor bug fixes and error message updates.

Changes since 0.9.8.14:
- Not much has changed functionality-wise, but there have
  been a number of bug fixes and we are building against the
  wxWidgets 2.9.1 platform.  This alpha release is now always
  recommended over Legacy Geoda.
- Major improvements in Linux.  There is no longer any drawing
  artifacts left on the screen.
- Flicker removed from Windows.
- Ability added to not draw polygon outlines.  This helps greatly
  when viewing maps with many regions.  Look for this new option
  under the Color submenu of the Options menu on any map. 
- Huge speed improvements during brushing operations when
  large maps are visible.  Brushing is now much faster than in
  Legacy GeoDa.

Changes since 0.9.8.13:
- A 'Unique / Key ID Variable' is no longer needed when opening
  up a SHP file.  In the Weights Creation dialog, there is now an
  easy way to directly add a new ID Variable to the DBF file
  directly if needed.  It is no longer possible to create a weights
  file without specifying an ID Variable.
- Weights File Creation dialog now opens the current project
  shape file by default.
- Select Weight dialog now opens up to the same directory
  as the currently open shape file.

Changes since 0.9.8.12:
- Re-enabled the ability to choose a character field from the DBF
  file as a key variable upon opening a shape file.  At the moment,
  character fields are not offered as an option in the weights
  creation dialog.  Use <Record ID> as a workaround if needed.

Changes since 0.9.8.11:
- Table 'Move Selected to Top' option only does something when at least one
  observation is selected.
- A widespread issue on Mac where parts of various images where
  being duplicated by being slightly shifted upwards has been solved.

Changes since 0.9.8.10:
- It is now possible to choose between Arc Distance / Euclidean
  Distance and Center Points / Mean Centers for all weights creation
  options that require distance between polygon / point centers.
- Arc distance calculation corrected: input  is degrees of lat/long
  and output is arc distance in miles with the assumption that earth
  is a perfect sphere with a radius of 3959 miles.
- 'Central Points' labels changed to 'Mean Center'.  The mean center
  calculation was previously incorrect.  Also note that legacy GeoDa
  incorrectly calls mean centers 'centroids'.  OpenGeoDa also offers
  centroids and these are now calculated correctly as the center of
  gravity..
- All weights creation functionality has been verified to be correct.  

Changes since 0.9.8.9:
- Solved an issue where Bivariate Map Movie would sometimes crash.
- Bivariate Equal Interval Map no longer crashes.
- Shape file to Boundary conversion crash on Windows is fixed.
- Shape File from ASCII import fixed.
- Table "Save to Shape File as ..." menu item working again.
- Data Export: Centroids/Mean Centers no longer results in an
   occasional crash.
- Shape File Creation: polygons from boundary now works.

Changes since 0.9.8.8:
- Hinge = 3.0 theme now works for various map smoothing options
- Map themes are disabled for "Excess Risk" smoothing option
- Labels for X, Y, and Z axes now appear in the 3D Control
  panel window (not in the 3D plot itself).  Previously the user
  had to remember which axis was which.
- Check-marks now accurately reflect the current chosen Map
  theme and smoothing function.
- The title for the main tool-bar window now changes to indicate
  which window is currently active.
- Labels for various Map windows (title and legend) have been
  corrected.
- Various bugs fixed to improved Table operation stability.  Many
  operations that would add a new column to the Table caused
  the program to crash previously.
- Weight-create toolbar item is always enabled.
- Restored Tools > Weights > Open and Properties menu options.
- A problem where shape files generated by OpenGeoDa could
  not be read by other GIS programs has been resolved.
- When opening a shape file, only columns of type integer are
  presented to the user as possible unique polygon identifiers.

Changes since 0.9.8.7:
- New image output formats: The "Save Image As" dialog now has options
  for BMP, PNG and PS.  The PS (PostScript) format is the default
  and this outputs a vector-graphics version.  This file can be
  easily converted to a PDF file with various free programs.
- Improved stability: several memory-leaks discovered and closed.
- Only SHP file name is displayed in the map title and legend rather
  than the full-path name and name with extension, respectively.
- First releases for Linux!  Download either 32-bit or 64-bit as
  appropriate.  The 64-bit version is less tested and is more
  prone to stability issues at this time.
